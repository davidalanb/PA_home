-----
0.1 
----- 
* codons grouped by nucleic acid
* only relevant codons included ([CTAG]{3}])
* only sequences beginning with ATG and ending with TAA|TAG|TGA counted
* gene count added to output
-----
0.2
-----
* check for start codons other than ATG (GTG|CTG|TTG|ATT)
	distinguish between when these codons are used as start and internally
* output ordered in "genetic code dictionary" order
-----
0.3
-----
* ignore tRNA sections
	not done for total script, not necessary for gbg script
* check for TGA that is a protein encoding internal codon
	done for gbg script, not total script
-----
0.4
-----
* count codons to produce codon frequency as a percentage
* added -c flag for count instead of frequency
* added -s flag to format output for input into spreadsheet	
-----
0.5
-----
* added -d flag for debugging output
* added -b flag for bias output
-----
0.6
-----
* third position base composition for four codon families only
-----
0.7
-----
* now bias output computes 3rd pos GATC bias for four codon families 
	(including 4 codon groups of 6 codon families) 
	3rd pos GA bias for 2 codon families ending in G or A
	3rd pos TC bias for 2 codon families ending in T or C
	(both include 2 codon groups of 6 codon families)
-----
0.8
-----
* now 3rd pos GATC bias for 4 codon families is computed per gene
-----
0.9
-----
* cleanup, changed variable names to make script more readable
