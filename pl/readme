NAME
	gbg-codon-usage -- gene by gene codon usage 

SYNOPSIS
	gbg-codon-usage [-s] [-c] [-d] [-b] geneFile.fna

DESCRIPTION
	gbg-codon-usage extracts codon usage information from nucleic acid 
	input files in Fasta format.  While it's intended to be used for files 
	where each sequence is a gene, it will work for any valid file and is,
	in fact, a sequence by sequence codon usage analyzer.

	By default, output goes to <output-geneFile.txt> and is in the form of
	a chart with gene id's on the y-axis and codons (grouped by nucleic 
	acid) on the x-axis, containing the frequency of x codon in y gene:
	
		(number of appearances of codon) / (total codons in gene)

	With the [-b] option specified, bias information is output to 
	<bias-geneFile.csv> in two charts.  The first has gene id's on the 
	y-axis and G,A,T,C on the x-axis, containing the frequency of x 
	nucleotide in the third position of codons in 4 codon amino acid 
	families:
		
		(# of times nucleotide appears in 3rd position of 4 codon 
		families) / (total number of codons in 4 codon families)

	The second chart contains the frequency aggregated over all genes, 
	and additionally G,A frequency in 2 codon families ending in G or A, 
	and T,C frequency in 2 codon families ending in T or C.

	Note: 6 codon amino acid families are separated into 4 group and 2 
	group, and represented in the appropriate chart. 

	The options are as follows:

	-s	output tsv (tab separated values) for spreadsheets to 
		<output-geneFile.csv>

	-c	output codon counts instead of frequency

	-d	output more codon info to <debug-geneFile.txt>
		(should only be run on very small input files)
 
	-b 	output bias information to <bias-geneFile.csv>
